    <p class="text-center px-48">     A semi-dedicated Christorian, Venetian mask collector, improv enthusiast,
        and professional time-waster, I like to focus on the hallucinogenic aspects of web design,
        such as "would this About Me page taste better if there was stock music playing whilst
        attempting to navigate it?"
        You can find me in my room most days, listening to Skynd and coding terrible videogames.
        Or banging on the piano loudly and badly much to my dearest mother's chagrin.

    <p class="text-center px-48">    I flew on an airplane sometime before starting this. During the flight, an attendent
        asked me if I'd ever been to Florida, to which I responed that I'd never been there,
        but that I knew of Florida, and had read extensively on the subject, as well as the 
        Gilded era of New York. The Gilded era, that sweet, wonderful period just before 
        prohibition, when the Charleston was but a glimmer in the eyes of Ward McAllister 
        and his elite 400.

    <p class="text-center px-48">    My name is Nolan. Chris has a neighbor named Nolan! That Nolan would give him a
        reeeaaally hard time when they were kids, like spreading a rumor that Chris liked to
        eat dirt. But Chris would hang out with him anyways because he was the only other kid 
        on the block. Also, I like the color orange! It reminds me of my ultimate dream
        of becoming a trapeez artist! And I personally feel that Sons of Tuscon was the single
        most underrated Fox series of all time.

        which I already have, but I am here mainly to learn JavaScript and improve my web development skills.
